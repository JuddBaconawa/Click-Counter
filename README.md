# Click Counter
The app pops a simple window containing a single button. The program "Click counter" is written in Java, utilizing a GUI to prompt the user to click on the window which is then counted after each click using a counter that displays how many times the button has been clicked.

This project showcases a simple understanding of how GUI (Graphical User Interface) works and how they are used.
